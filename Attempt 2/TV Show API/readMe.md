- **Dynamic Image Display:** Fetches TV show data and displays show images based on search results.
- **Query String Handling:** emonstrates dynamic query string creation using Axios for API requests.

### Implementation Details

- **Frontend** Implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **External Libraries:** Utilizes Axios for making API requests.
- **Event Handling:** Uses form submission to trigger the TV show search and API request.
- **API Interaction:**  Parses API response data and dynamically displays TV show images.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in a web browser.
3. Enter a TV show title in the search input field and click "Search".
